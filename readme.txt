July 11th 2020 - Update Research Article-  Aritificial Inteligence for damage detection 

Fields: AI, Civil Engineering, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Python Script, Structural Health Monitoring

In this repository you will find:
	1 - Neural Network Rev1.py
	2 - Damage Creation.py
	input_pasarela4.csv
	test1.csv

1 script using python that generates a .csv file used as input in the neural network script
1 script using python and libraries (Keras, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas) that reads the .csv file and generates a .csv file that predicts wich beam is damaged
