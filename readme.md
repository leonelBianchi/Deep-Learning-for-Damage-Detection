# Deep learning for damage detection

	- Fields: AI, Civil Engineering, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Structural Health Monitoring, Technology
	- Deep learning model that takes dynamic properties of the structure (in this case a pedestrian bridge) as input to predict in which area of the structure there is damage (simulated as a decrease in its rigidity). This allows remote and rapid monitoring of structures at low computational cost.

# Files

	- Neural Network Rev1.py (script using python that generates a .csv file used as input in the neural network script)
	- Damage Creation.py (cript using python and libraries (Keras, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas) that reads the .csv file and generates a .csv file that predicts wich beam is damaged)
	- input_pasarela4.csv
	- test1.csv
